// Program: The purpose of this program is to calculate monthly loan payments
// Process: Obtain input from user: loan type, length of loan, amount of loan
//          and compute monthly payment.
// Results: Display details of the loan along with the calculated payment, total
//          paid over the life of the loan, and total interest paid.
